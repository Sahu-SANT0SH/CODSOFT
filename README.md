# CODSOFT
Internship Experience with CodSoft-  I recently completed a valuable and learnful internship with CodSoft, where I had the opportunity to enhance my programming skills through hands-on projects.
During this journey, I worked on:
Simple Calculator: Built a basic calculator that performed arithmetic operations, helping me strengthen my understanding of functions and conditional logic.

Password Generator: Created a tool to generate strong, random passwords using Python libraries, which improved my knowledge of string handling and randomization.

Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: Developed an interactive game where the user plays against the computer, giving me practical experience with loops, input handling, and game logic.

This internship provided me with practical exposure, boosted my confidence in coding, and helped me build a strong foundation in programming.
